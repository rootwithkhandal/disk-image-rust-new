# OpenForensic PGP Cryptographic Integrity Manifests Guide

## 📌 Overview

In modern Digital Forensics and Incident Response (DFIR), proving bit-for-bit data integrity is only half the battle. When submitting evidence in legal proceedings, regulatory audits, or criminal prosecutions, investigators must establish an **unassailable chain of custody**. This requires proving not only that the evidence image has not been altered, but also **who** acquired it, **when** it was sealed, and that the metadata itself has not been tampered with.

OpenForensic integrates native support for **RFC 4880 OpenPGP Cryptographic Integrity Manifests**. By combining multi-algorithm cryptographic hashing (SHA-256, SHA-512) with asymmetric public-key cryptography (RSA-4096, Ed25519), OpenForensic generates tamper-evident digital signatures that mathematically bind evidence containers to the investigating examiner or agency.

## 🔍 What is a PGP Integrity Manifest?

An **Integrity Manifest** is a structured document accompanying acquired forensic evidence (such as `.dd`, `.e01`, or `.aff` images). It acts as a comprehensive bill of materials and digital seal containing:
1. **Case & Investigator Metadata**: Case ID, Evidence Tag, Examiner Name, Agency Name, and acquisition timestamps.
2. **Device Specifications**: Source block device path, serial number, sector size, and total byte count.
3. **Cryptographic Hashes**: The calculated MD5, SHA-1, SHA-256, and SHA-512 bit-stream hashes of the acquired image files.
4. **PGP Cryptographic Signature**: A digital signature generated using the examiner's private PGP key over the entire manifest content.

If even a single byte of the underlying forensic image or a single character in the manifest metadata is altered after the signature is applied, verification will fail immediately.

## ⭐ Key Capabilities in OpenForensic

### 1. In-App Keypair Generation & Management
You do not need external command-line tools like GnuPG or OpenSSL installed on your workstation. OpenForensic includes a pure-Rust OpenPGP cryptographic engine that allows investigators to:
* **Generate High-Security Keypairs**: Create industry-standard **RSA-4096** or modern elliptic curve **Ed25519** keypairs in seconds.
* **Inspect Key Metadata**: View ASCII-armored public/private keys, cryptographic fingerprints, creation timestamps, and associated user identities (`Name <email@agency.gov>`).
* **Export & Import Keys**: Seamlessly import existing agency PGP keys or export public keys to accompany evidence distribution disks.

### 2. Tamper-Evident Manifest Verification
The interactive **PGP Keys & Manifests** workbench allows instant validation of forensic packages. When you load a manifest:
1. **Signature Authentication**: OpenForensic parses the ASCII-armored PGP signature block and verifies authenticity using the loaded public key.
2. **Hash Validation**: The engine parses the embedded SHA-256/SHA-512 hashes and validates them against the stored evidence file.
3. **Court-Ready Audit Log**: Displays explicit verification status, highlighting exact match confirmation or alerting immediately to signature mismatch or data corruption.

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Usage Guide

### Step 1: Accessing the PGP Workbench
1. Launch OpenForensic and navigate to the **🔑 PGP Keys & Manifests** tab in the main navigation bar.
2. You will see two panels: **PGP Key Management** on the left and **Manifest Verification** on the right.

### Step 2: Generating a New Examiner Keypair
If you do not already have an examiner key pair loaded:
1. Under **Generate New Keypair**, enter your official details:
   * **Investigator Name**: e.g., `Det. Alex Mercer`
   * **Agency Email**: e.g., `amercer@cyberforensics.gov`
   * **Key Algorithm**: Select either `RSA (4096-bit)` (recommended for maximum legacy compatibility) or `Ed25519` (recommended for speed and modern cryptography).
2. Click **⚡ Generate Keypair**.
3. Within a few seconds, the generated ASCII-armored Public and Private keys will appear in the text area, and the **Active Key Information** card will update with your unique **Key Fingerprint** and creation timestamp.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> **Secure Key Storage**: Always back up your generated private key to a secure, encrypted offline USB token or agency credential vault. Never distribute your private key with evidence packages.

### Step 3: Loading and Inspecting Existing Keys
If your agency already issued an OpenPGP key:
1. Paste your ASCII-armored PGP key block (starting with `-----BEGIN PGP PRIVATE KEY BLOCK-----` or `-----BEGIN PGP PUBLIC KEY BLOCK-----`) directly into the **ASCII Armored PGP Key** text box.
2. Click **🔍 Load / Inspect Key**.
3. OpenForensic will parse the key structure, validate its checksums, and display the key fingerprint and identity.

### Step 4: Verifying a Forensic Integrity Manifest
To verify an evidence container received from field acquisition or long-term archiving:
1. In the **Manifest Verification** panel on the right, enter the full path to the `.manifest` or `.sig` file in the **Manifest File Path** input box, or click **📂 Browse Manifest** to select it via the file dialog.
2. Ensure the corresponding Public Key of the investigator who acquired the image is loaded in the key panel.
3. Click **🛡️ Verify PGP Manifest**.
4. OpenForensic will execute the verification pipeline and display a structured summary:
   * **Status**: `VERIFIED (Tamper-Free)` in green or `VERIFICATION FAILED` in red.
   * **Signer Identity**: The exact name and email bound to the cryptographic signature.
   * **Hash Comparison**: Visual confirmation of the manifest's cryptographic digests against the evidence payload.

## 💻 CLI & External Verification (GnuPG Compatibility)

Because OpenForensic adheres strictly to the RFC 4880 OpenPGP standard, manifests generated by OpenForensic can be verified on any Linux, macOS, or Windows workstation using standard open-source command-line tools without requiring OpenForensic to be installed.

### Verifying with GnuPG (`gpg`)
To verify an OpenForensic signature using standard GnuPG in a terminal or automated CI/CD pipeline:

```bash
# 1. Import the investigator's public key
gpg --import investigator_public.asc

# 2. Verify the detached signature against the evidence image
gpg --verify disk_image.manifest
```

If the manifest is valid, GnuPG will output:
```text
gpg: Signature made Thu Jul  2 12:00:00 2026 IST
gpg:                using RSA key 4A82B1C9D3E5F701...
gpg: Good signature from "Det. Alex Mercer <amercer@cyberforensics.gov>" [ultimate]
```

## 🛡️ Best Practices for Chain of Custody

1. **Sign Immediately Upon Acquisition**: Always generate and sign the PGP integrity manifest at the exact conclusion of physical imaging while the write-blocker is still engaged.
2. **Distribute Public Keys Separately**: When transferring evidence to prosecuting attorneys, opposing counsel, or cold storage, transmit the evidence image and `.manifest` file together, but provide your official PGP Public Key (`.asc`) through an authenticated secondary channel (e.g., official agency correspondence or keyserver).
3. **Periodic Archive Auditing**: For evidence stored in long-term cold vaults, routinely run OpenForensic verification or headless batch scripts against archived manifests to prove that bit rot or storage degradation has not affected the evidence.
